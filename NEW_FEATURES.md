# New Features - Type Royale v2.2.0

## üéØ Overview

Two major features have been added to Type Royale:
1. **Disband Room** - Host can delete game rooms
2. **Save Screenshot** - Download game results as PNG

---

## üóëÔ∏è Feature 1: Disband Room

### Description
Game room owners (hosts) can now permanently delete their game room at any time, removing all players and clearing the game from memory.

### Where It Appears
- **Game Lobby** - Large "Disband Room" button below "Start Game"
- **During Game** - Small "Disband" button in top-right of Live Progress card

### How It Works
1. **Host-Only Access**: Only the player who created the room can disband it
2. **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental deletion with AlertDialog
3. **Instant Deletion**: Removes game from server storage
4. **Auto-Redirect**: All players redirected to homepage
5. **Toast Notification**: Confirms successful deletion

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified:
- `src/app/actions.ts` - Added `disbandGame()` server action
- `src/components/game/GameLobby.tsx` - Added disband button with confirmation
- `src/components/game/TypingGame.tsx` - Added disband button during gameplay

#### Code Highlights:

**Server Action (`src/app/actions.ts`):**
```typescript
export async function disbandGame(roomId: string) {
  console.log('[DisbandGame] Disbanding game:', roomId);
  
  const game = storage.getGame(roomId);
  
  if (!game) {
    throw new Error('Game not found');
  }

  // Delete the game from storage
  storage.deleteGame(roomId);
  
  console.log('[DisbandGame] Game deleted:', roomId);
  
  // Redirect to homepage
  redirect('/');
}
```

**UI Components:**
- Uses Radix UI `AlertDialog` for confirmation
- Red destructive styling to indicate danger
- Disabled state during operation
- Toast notifications for feedback

### User Flow:
```
1. Host clicks "Disband Room" button
   ‚Üì
2. AlertDialog appears: "Are you absolutely sure?"
   ‚Üì
3. Host confirms: "Yes, Disband Room"
   ‚Üì
4. Game deleted from storage
   ‚Üì
5. All players redirected to homepage
   ‚Üì
6. Toast: "Room Disbanded"
```

## üì∏ Feature 2: Save Screenshot

### Description
Players can download the game results summary as a high-quality PNG image to share or keep as a record of their performance.

### Where It Appears
- **Game Results Screen** - "Save Screenshot" button in top-right corner
- Appears after any game ends, before rematch voting

### How It Works
1. **html2canvas Integration**: Captures the entire results card as an image
2. **High Quality**: 2x scale for crisp, clear screenshots
3. **Auto-Download**: PNG file downloads immediately to device
4. **Timestamped Filename**: `type-royale-results-YYYY-MM-DD.png`
5. **Loading State**: Shows "Saving..." with spinner during capture
6. **Toast Feedback**: Confirms successful save or shows error

### Technical Implementation

#### Dependencies Added:
- `html2canvas@^1.4.1` - Screenshot capture library

#### Files Modified:
- `package.json` - Added html2canvas dependency
- `src/components/game/GameResults.tsx` - Added screenshot functionality

#### Code Highlights:

**Screenshot Handler:**
```typescript
const handleSaveScreenshot = async () => {
  if (!cardRef.current) return;
  
  setIsDownloading(true);
  try {
    // Capture the card as a canvas
    const canvas = await html2canvas(cardRef.current, {
      backgroundColor: '#222222',
      scale: 2, // Higher quality
      logging: false,
      useCORS: true,
    });
    
    // Convert to blob and download
    canvas.toBlob((blob) => {
      if (blob) {
        const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
        const link = document.createElement('a');
        const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-').split('T')[0];
        link.download = `type-royale-results-${timestamp}.png`;
        link.href = url;
        link.click();
        URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
        
        toast({
          title: 'Screenshot Saved!',
          description: 'Your game results have been downloaded as a PNG.',
        });
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Screenshot error:', error);
    toast({
      title: 'Screenshot Failed',
      description: 'Could not capture the screenshot. Please try again.',
      variant: 'destructive',
    });
  } finally {
    setIsDownloading(false);
  }
};
```

**UI Integration:**
- Button with Download icon
- Loading state with spinner
- Positioned in top-right of results card
- Uses React `useRef` to capture specific DOM element

### Screenshot Configuration:
- **Background Color**: `#222222` (dark gray) matches app theme
- **Scale**: `2x` for high DPI displays
- **CORS**: Enabled to capture external resources
- **Logging**: Disabled for cleaner console

### User Flow:
```
1. Game ends, results screen appears
   ‚Üì
2. Player clicks "Save Screenshot" button
   ‚Üì
3. Button shows "Saving..." with spinner
   ‚Üì
4. html2canvas captures the results card
   ‚Üì
5. PNG file downloads automatically
   ‚Üì
6. Toast: "Screenshot Saved!"
   ‚Üì
7. File saved as: type-royale-results-2025-10-28.png
