## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Render Free Tier Spin-Down

**Issue:** Free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity

**Solutions:**
1. **Accept 30-second cold start** (first request after spin-down)
2. **Create Render Cron Job** to ping every 14 minutes (free!)
3. **Upgrade to $7/month** for always-on service

### Games Lost on Server Restart

**Issue:** In-memory storage clears on restart

**Solutions:**
1. **Current:** Accept that games are temporary
2. **Later:** Add Redis or PostgreSQL for persistence
