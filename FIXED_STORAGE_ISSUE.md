# 🔴 FIXED: "Game not found" Error on Vercel

## The Problem

Your game was showing `{"error":"Game not found"}` on Vercel because:

**In-memory storage doesn't work in serverless!**

- ❌ Localhost: Server runs continuously → Memory persists
- ❌ Vercel: Each API call = new serverless function → Memory resets
- ❌ Result: Games created are immediately lost

---

## The Solution

✅ **Implemented Vercel KV (Redis) for persistent storage**

Changes made:
1. Added `@vercel/kv` package
2. Updated `src/lib/storage.ts` to use KV in production
3. Made all storage calls async (`await storage.getGame()`)
4. Updated all API routes and actions

---

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Create Vercel KV Database

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "Storage" → "Create Database"
3. Select "KV" (Redis)
4. Name it: `type-royale-kv`
5. Connect it to your project
6. **Done!** Environment variables auto-configured ✅

### 2. Redeploy Your App

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel KV storage for production"
git push origin main
```

Or in Vercel Dashboard:
- Go to Deployments
- Click (...) on latest
- Click "Redeploy"

## How It Works Now

### Development (localhost):
```
✓ Uses in-memory storage (fast, simple)
✓ No setup needed
✓ Works as before
```

### Production (Vercel):
```
✓ Uses Vercel KV (Redis)
✓ Games persist across requests
✓ Automatic 24-hour expiration
✓ Handles serverless perfectly
```

**The app automatically detects which to use!**

---

## Verification

After deploying with KV:

1. **Create a game** on your deployed URL
2. **Copy the room ID**
3. **Test with curl**:
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/games/ROOMID
```

4. **Should return game data** instead of "Game not found" ✅

---

## Environment Variables

Vercel automatically adds these when you connect KV:
```
KV_REST_API_URL=https://...
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=...
```

No manual configuration needed! 🎉

---

## Changes Made to Your Code

### `package.json`
```diff
+ "@vercel/kv": "^3.0.0"
```

### `src/lib/storage.ts`
```typescript
// Now uses KV in production, memory in development
import { kv } from '@vercel/kv';

// Auto-detects environment
const isProduction = process.env.KV_REST_API_URL && process.env.KV_REST_API_TOKEN;

// All methods now async
getGame: async (gameId) => { ... }
setGame: async (gameId, game) => { ... }
```

### All API Routes & Actions
```diff
- const game = storage.getGame(roomId);
+ const game = await storage.getGame(roomId);

- storage.setGame(roomId, game);
+ await storage.setGame(roomId, game);
```

## Quick Setup Checklist

- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build` ✅ (Already verified)
- [ ] Create Vercel KV database
- [ ] Connect KV to your project
- [ ] Deploy/Redeploy app
- [ ] Test game creation
- [ ] Verify persistence

---

## Summary

**Before:**
```
Create game → Serverless function starts
Game saved to memory ✓
Function ends → Memory cleared ✗
Next request → Game gone! ❌
```

**After:**
```
Create game → Serverless function starts  
Game saved to KV (Redis) ✓
Function ends → KV persists ✓
Next request → Game still there! ✅
```

---

**Your app is now production-ready! 🚀**

Games will persist properly on Vercel with KV storage!
